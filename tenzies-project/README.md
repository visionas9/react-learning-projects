# React Learning Journey ⚛️

Welcome to my portfolio of React projects! This repository tracks my progress as I master modern web development, starting from the basics and moving to advanced concepts.

## 📂 Project 1: Tenzies Game 🎲

A fast-paced, interactive dice game built to master React State and Side Effects.

### 🎮 How to Play

1. Click **"Roll"** to generate new dice numbers.
2. Click any die to **"Freeze"** it (keep its value).
3. Keep rolling until all dice are the same number.
4. When you win, celebrate with the confetti animation! 🎉

### 🛠️ Built With

- **React:** Used `useState` for game logic and `useEffect` for the win condition.
- **Vite:** For a lightning-fast development environment.
- **CSS:** Custom styling for a clean, modern "Dark Mode" aesthetic.
- **Packages:** `react-confetti` for the victory animation.

### 🚀 Key Features

- **State Management:** Tracking the value and "held" status of 10 independent dice components.
- **Conditional Rendering:** The button changes from "Roll" to "New Game" upon winning.
- **Side Effects:** The game automatically detects when you have won using `useEffect`.
